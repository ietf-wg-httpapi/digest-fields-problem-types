Handling HTTP message signatures can fail due to various reason and we do not want to define a problem type for every scenario to avoid blowing up the draft. In addition, a server might not want to expose certain errors to the client.\r\n\r\nWe should explore if we can easily define a small set of problem types that work for signatures and digests.",

It keeps the draft focused and concise, avoiding a situation where this document is dragged on for a long time. In addition, I'm not expert at HTTP signatures and could contribute little to designing corresponding problem types.\n\nThat being said, there was some interest in problem types for signatures. But maybe that's better reserved for a separate document.",

Maybe through a secdir early review?",
