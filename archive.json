Handling HTTP message signatures can fail due to various reason and we do not want to define a problem type for every scenario to avoid blowing up the draft. In addition, a server might not want to expose certain errors to the client.\r\n\r\nWe should explore if we can easily define a small set of problem types that work for signatures and digests.",

Maybe through a secdir early review?",
